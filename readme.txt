== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does ERP cost? =
ERP is completely free of cost, you can download and install the plugin right from your WordPress dashboard just like any other WordPress plugin.

= Can I use only one module? =
Yes, you definitely can! The whole plugin is divided into three parts- HR, CRM, and Accounting based on features and the source code are separate for each module. So you can turn on or off any module you like from the settings.

= Can I customize the plugin? =
Absolutely! ERP and all its extensions are open-source and the source files are well-documented. So you can customize any feature you want. Our support service is always there to help you with information to get you started.

We are always here to help you with more information to get started.

= Is ERP Multi-Site Compatible? =
You can use one ERP installation on 1 database. That means one WordPress installation can have only one ERP activation. You can install and activate the plugin on a single sub-site of a network installation. But ERP can not be used across multiple sub-sites of a network installation.

= Can I use ERP from the front end? =
You can use the HR module from the frontend now by using the [“HR Frontend”](https://wperp.com/downloads/hr-frontend/) extension. The CRM & Accounting module does not have a frontend right now.

= How can I get continuous support and updates after one year? =
To get continuous support and updates on our products you just need to renew the license.
